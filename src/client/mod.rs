//! Telemetry subscribers: local Unix socket and remote mTLS.

//! Both readers run on their own thread and **auto-reconnect**: if the
//! producer restarts (or the connection drops), the thread keeps retrying
//! until the client is dropped. Messages are delivered over a bounded channel
//! so a slow UI cannot cause unbounded memory growth — excess frames are
//! dropped (the protocol sends periodic full snapshots, so the UI re-syncs on
//! the next one).
